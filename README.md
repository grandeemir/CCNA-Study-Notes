📝 CCNA 200-301 v1.1 Study Notes

Welcome to my repository for studying and reviewing the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification (Exam 200-301 v1.1).

This repository contains my personal notes, configurations, diagrams, and resources compiled during my CCNA preparation. It is intended to be a centralized, accessible resource for myself and anyone else studying for the certification.
